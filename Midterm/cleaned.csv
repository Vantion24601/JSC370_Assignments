We do this by building and running the world's best data and AI infrastructure platform, so our customers can focus on the high value challenges that are central to their own missions.

Founded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark, Databricks has grown from a tiny corner office in Berkeley, California to a global organization with over 1000 employees. Thousands of organizations, from small to Fortune 100, trust Databricks with their mission-critical workloads, making us one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in the world.

Our engineering teams build highly technical products that fulfill real, important needs in the world. We constantly push the boundaries of data and AI technology, while simultaneously operating with the resilience, security and scale that is critical to making customers successful on our platform.

We develop and operate one of the largest scale software platforms. The fleet consists of millions of virtual machines, generating terabytes of logs and processing exabytes of data per day. At our scale, we regularly observe cloud hardware, network, and operating system faults, and our software must gracefully shield our customers from any of the above.

Modern data analysis employs sophisticated methods such as machine learning that go well beyond the roll-up and drill-down capabilities of traditional SQL query engines.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

 Athenian Project  : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

We are the largest nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Founded on a simple premise: people everywhere, regardless of identity or circumstances, should have the chance to live healthy, productive lives. We believe our employees should reflect the rich diversity of the global populations we aim to serve. We provide an exceptional benefits package to employees and their families which include comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage with no premiums, generous paid time off, paid family leave, foundation-paid retirement contribution, regional holidays, and opportunities to engage in several employee communities. As a workplace, we’re committed to creating an environment for you to thrive both personally and professionally.

The Team

The Africa Team works to enable the foundation’s high-reaching goals of scaling evidence-based interventions that target a range of diseases and socio-economic conditions which are endemic across Sub-Saharan Africa. The team drives its responsibility through direct country engagement to deploy interventions and delivery models, and by building the partner architecture to replicate successful interventions and models across multiple countries.

Our Africa Data and Digital Portfolio seeks to support and invest in country and regional institutions within the continent with the aim of capitalizing on the demographic dividend of energetic local talent and helping governments strengthen measurement systems and sequence reforms in pragmatic, coordinated and cost-effective ways that will both enhance the clarity and use of data for delivery and inform effective resource allocation in budget constrained environments. It aims to help governments systematically and responsibly harness, test and scale the potential of digital transformation and automation in improving efficiencies and accountability in transactional and operational systems and increasing citizen inclusion.

Our portfolio is driven by a set of core principles that include a strong belief in country ownership; the importance of helping governments have choice and make informed evidence based decisions; strengthening coordination and reducing fragmentation; sequential and long term approaches to change; investing in local ecosystems especially harnessing the power of youth and women; and the ability to experiment, test, innovate and build evidence to inform responsible scale up of interventions with a grounded and deep understanding of country contexts, realities and starting points. We are data driven and like to explore, analyze, understand and draw insights to inform our internal and external engagements. Part of our portfolio focuses on generating insights by using data, research and analysis to illuminate progress, challenges and inequities within and across the continent pertaining to key social challenges such as reducing maternal and child mortality or measuring health service coverage and the social determinants that affect equitable coverage. We are interested drawing insights and exploring how we can collectively address delivery challenges facing sectors such as health and understanding why certain populations continue to be excluded from key basic services.

Rounding out Marketing Contacts. Entering names and contact information for our targeted marketing audience (currently 20,000) and entering those into our existing systems.

Right now, we're averaging maybe over 100 a week.
Eventually, we will be looking to add the following tasks:1. Increasing our marketing contacts. This requires us to reach out to lead agencies to get new names, emails, and phone numbers. It also requires connecting with companies that work with similar, but not the same, clientele to see if we can collaborate.

We need to look into where case managers find their listings or look for openings, and see if we can advertise there. We currently advertise with about 4 companies, but we'd like to expand. Part of this process, for me at least, has been to reach out to other providers like us to ask where they advertise. And more often than not, ""advertising"" involves publicizing our openings/services and maintaining those listings.Requirements:- Proficiency in data entry and basic math skills- Strong attention to detail and accuracy- Excellent organizational and time management skills- Proficiency in Microsoft Office, particularly Excel- Ability to work independently and as part of a team- Strong written and verbal communication skillsNote: Previous experience in customer service or data entry is preferred, but not required."
